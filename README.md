# p5r-3ds-entry-test
This is a test to see if i am even able to make a game using devkitpro's 3ds library.


My end goal for this is to have a functioning opening sequence (companies, network, opening movie and whatnot) just like the original game.

I might switch this to be persona 4 golden instead because I think it will be a little more simple for me to do (I'm retarded) and the game is older and won't give the 3ds an aneurysm

I'm going to try to make this easy to build so if you are having trouble building (doesnt compile on first try) tell me what it says and i'll look into fixing it
