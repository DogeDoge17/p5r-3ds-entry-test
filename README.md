# p5r-3ds-entry-test
This is a test to see if i am even able to make a game using devkitpro's 3ds library.


My end goal for this is to have a functioning opening sequence (companies, network, opening movie and whatnot) just like the original game.

I might switch this to be persona 4 golden instead because I think it will be a little more simple for me to do (I'm retarded) and the game is older and won't give the 3ds an aneurysm
